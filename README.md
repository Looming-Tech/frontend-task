# frontend-task

The goal of the application is to have a calendar to manage users meetings.
A meeting must contain - start/end hours, name, meeting room. The calendar must be populated from the attached JSON file.
 
Two meetings can't be placed in the same room at the same time.
 
** **Front End task** **

For the current implementation we ask you to create the calendar's view and skip user authentication and any kind of session management.
Create a calendar view with one month per screen. Navigation through all months is also desired. You should not use any of the existing calendar API's.
Each day should be represented by a cell large enough to contain at least 3 of the meetings for the day. When a cell is selected all the meetings should be displayed in a pop-up window. All meetings should be arranged by their starting time.
Please focus on the visuals, it is important to be responsive without the use of **Bootstrap** to demonstrate **CSS** skills
